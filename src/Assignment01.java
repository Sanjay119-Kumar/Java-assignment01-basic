    /*
Q.8-> What is the difference between pascal case, snake case and camel case??
ANS-->

++ 1. Pascal Case: ++

->Each word starts with an uppercase letter.
->No spaces or underscores.
->Example: ThisIsPascalCase
->Common Usage: Class names in languages like C# and Java.

++ 2. Snake Case: ++

->All letters are lowercase.
->Words are separated by underscores.
->Example: this_is_snake_case
->Common Usage: Variable names in Python and database naming.

++ 3. Camel Case: ++

->The first word starts with a lowercase letter.
->Subsequent words start with uppercase letters.
->Example: thisIsCamelCase
->Common Usage: Variable and function names in languages like Java and JavaScript.

    |Case Style  |	Example           |	Common Usage
    |-----------------------------------------------------
    |Pascal Case | ThisIsPascalCase   |	Class names java
    |Snake Case	 | this_is_snake_case |	Variable names in Python
    |Camel Case	 | thisIsCamelCase	  |  Variable and function names java


Q.9. why main method is static in java
ANS-->


->No Instance Needed:
Can be called without creating an object of the class.

->JVM Access:
Allows the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to invoke it directly.

->Simplifies Execution:
Makes it the entry point for program execution without extra setup.

->Consistency:
Aligns with how other static methods work in Java.

Q.10. difference between printf() and println() methods of printStream class
ANS-->

Difference Between printf() and println()

->Purpose:
println(): Prints text followed by a new line.
printf(): Formats and prints text without adding a new line by default.

->Syntax:
println(): System.out.println("Text");
printf(): System.out.printf("Formatted text", args);

->Formatting:
println(): No formatting options.
printf(): Supports format specifiers (e.g., %s, %d).

->Return Type:
Both return void, but printf() can be chained with other methods(printStream instance).

->Example:
println(): System.out.println("Hello!");
Output: Hello!

printf(): System.out.printf("Value: %d", 10);
Output: Value: 10

Q.10. -> What is JRE in Java?

->Java Runtime Environment (JRE):
Definition: JRE is the environment that allows Java applications to run on a device.

>Components:
Java Virtual Machine (JVM): Executes Java bytecode and enables platform independence.
Java Class Libraries: Predefined classes and APIs that provide essential functionality.

-->Purpose:
Provides everything needed to run Java applications without the full Java Development Kit (JDK).

->Installation:
Can be installed separately or comes bundled with applications. Essential for running Java programs.

->JRE vs. JDK:
JRE: Specifically for running Java applications.
JDK: Includes JRE plus development tools for building Java applications.
->Key Point:
The JRE ensures that Java applications can be executed seamlessly across different platforms, making Java a versatile choice for developers.
